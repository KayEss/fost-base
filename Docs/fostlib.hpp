/** \namespace fostlib

    \brief The fostlib namespace is the main namespace used for the Fost libraries.

    This namespace is used for all of the library code within all of the Fost libraries. Application code, for example in the examples, is generally in the global namespace, although larger examples may define their own namespaces.

/** \namespace fostlib::detail

    \brief Used for implementation classes and functions that are needed in public headers so the compiler can generate code. No members of this namespace should be used outside of the implementation of Fost itself.
