2011-10-22  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Clear out the jobs that have been taken from the queue when a major problem occurs. This should help to stop threads waiting on futures from waiting forever.

2011-04-09  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 The insert functions for JSON values now use a coerce rather than a JSON constructor so the API will work with more data types.

2011-03-11  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Updated the build system so that there is a new fost-integration-test target that will create a test executable that can be run at any later stage as well as run the tests during the build process.

2011-03-04  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 The jcursor constructor can now take up to four arguments and build a cursor path from them.

 Added a new basic logging library.

2010-11-09  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>

2010-11-05  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
